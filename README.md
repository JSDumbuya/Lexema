# CaseRank

CaseRank is a full-stack web application that builds on my thesis project, ReqRank. ReqRank used artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as word embeddings and sentiment analysis, to rank software requirements based on textual user feedback. CaseRank incorporates the feedback and suggestions received during user testing of ReqRank and shifts the focus toward ranking support cases, helping support teams prioritize the most urgent cases, ensuring high user satisfaction and efficciency.

Now you should be able to interact with ReqRank!
